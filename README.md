# 20 React: React Portfolio

## Description

---

Hi, my name is Bryan Sayavong!

Recently I've taken the interest in learning a new language. After deciding which language I wanted to learn it became apparent that if that verbal language was not going to be regularly used I would soon forget how to speak the language. That is when I found out about web languages and shortly after developed the interest in leanring how to code. With some sleepless nights researching I quickly found out how lucrative and gratifying it can be building an application from an abstract concept or shall I say plain text. With my current line of work, too often do I use applications from large companies where a feature is not fully functioning and refined. As a natural tinkerer I wanted to take it upon myself and learn to figure out and diagnose those issues let alone figure out the point of failure. Coding is the next chapter in my life where I knew to stay competetive in today's job market that I had to learn a new skill.
